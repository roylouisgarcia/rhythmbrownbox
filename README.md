# A Simple Drum Machine

Using the Nexus API and Web Audio API, a drum machine will provide users to create basic drum beats. It is an exercise on UI integration and API usage.

## Installation

Fork the project and it will work as is. The only javascript library needed is the nexusUI.js. At the moment, I avoided creating subfolders to make paths assignment to variables simpler

## Built With

* [nexusosc.com](http://nexusosc.com/) - Audio Interfaces in the Browser
* [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) - a system to control audio on the web
